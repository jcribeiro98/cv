### First job in Machine Learning ðŸ¤–

My carreer in Machine Learning started in a Technological Consultant named Gradiant (Vigo, Spain). My worked focused on research in Data Efficiency and Data Valuation for efficient training of CV models. This work was supported by the University of Santiago de Compostela as part of my Master's Thesis. Here, we developed GEDA, a Gradient-based efficiency method. We obtained up to a 40% speed-up in time compared with the full-training, and almost no reduction in accuracy (<1%).

I also collaborated in the "Valida" project for AI-driven anti-spoofing system for official travel documments before starting my PhD. 

I couldn't ask more for a starting position: I learned correct CI/CD practices, DVC, collaborated in cutting edge AI research, and honed my Python skills with the guidance of my mentors.
