### My teaching obligations 👨‍🏫

Besides research, teaching is also an important part of my daily work. 

Supervising bachelor and master theses, teaching laboratory courses and supervising seminars are my most common activities. I also teach the second semester lecture in Database Systems as part of the SQL group. In addition to supervising the exam, I am one of the people responsible for preparing, correcting and revising the SQL section of the exam. 

While teaching doesn't improve any of my hard skills in ML, it is a great way to practise a large number of soft skills. Scientific communication, information organisation, product management, and especially group task management.
