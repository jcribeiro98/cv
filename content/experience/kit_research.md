### Subspace-based Knowledge Discovery in Large Databases ðŸŽ“

My main research focuses on outlier detection in large databases, especially tabular data. Here, my focus is on subspace-driven techniques, where the data, due to its complexity, needs to be examined from multiple subspaces. Determining how to study each subspace, and which subspaces to study in the first place, is the core of my work. 

I use a variety of techniques in this area, in particular deep learning, self-supervised generative methods for knowledge discovery, and kernel methods. I've also studied text and image data for this task, focusing on the ability to solve image/text OD using these techniques. Other interests include functional data and information geometry. 

Some other research/collaborations of mine include experimental design & study, and data quality.
